### Challenge

Write a function that takes an Int and breaks it into its expanded form, returning each component in an array.

Test cases:

```swift
 expandTheNumber(199)  // [100, 90, 9]
 expandTheNumber(100)  // [100, 0, 0]
 expandTheNumber(0)    // [0]
 expandTheNumber(562)  // [500, 60, 2]
 expandTheNumber(5280) // [5000, 200, 80, 0]
 expandTheNumber(560)  // [500, 60, 0]
```
